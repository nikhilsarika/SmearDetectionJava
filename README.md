# SmearDetectionJava


### What youâ€™ll need
+ A favorite text editor or IDE (Intellij or Ecliplse IDE)
+ JDK 8 or later
+ Install Gradle


### Steps to Run the project 
+ Open SmearDetection.java and update the smearDirectory(this the path with all the sample images specific to a camera)
+ Run the SmearDetection.java file 

### Notes
+ The smearDirectory path should be specific to a particular camera images. In our case it was "C:/Users/Nikhil/Downloads/sample_drive/sample_drive/cam_4/"
+ The smearDirectory should be updated to test images from a different folder. In the above case the path was specific to cam_4.
+ Each folder would need about 15-20 minutes to detect smears and save output images to the smearDirectory
+ Gradle would need internet connection to download the required opencv dependencies

### Output from the code is copied into the smearDirectory folder with the below names
+ Intermediate.jpg
+ FinalImage.jpg
+ averageimage.jpg
